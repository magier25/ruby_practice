In this exercise, you'll create a class to output the lyrics to the traditional English Christmas carol "The Twelve Days of Christmas" (complete lyrics below).

In this song, each verse is built on top of the previous verses in a repeating pattern. Can you use Ruby to build up the repeated lyrics programmatically?

Note on testing: Unlike previous exercises, this exercise doesn't include an extensive set of test cases. Instead, there is an "acceptance" test to make sure that the final output is correct. A file called song.txt is included with the exercise, but this is to be used for the acceptance test to validate the solution, not as part of the solution itself.
